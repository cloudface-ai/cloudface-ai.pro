## The Coca-Cola Photo Challenge: 2.3 Million Images and Counting

When Coca-Cola launches a global campaign, they don't just create advertisements‚Äîthey create **visual ecosystems**. A single "Share a Coke" campaign generates over **2.3 million photos** across 200+ countries, featuring celebrities, influencers, brand ambassadors, and real consumers.

But here's the challenge: **How do you find specific people across millions of photos in real-time?**

## Inside Coca-Cola's Global Events Operation

### **The Scale is Staggering:**

**Global Campaign Numbers:**
- üåç **200+ countries** simultaneously
- üì∏ **50,000+ photos** per major event
- ‚≠ê **500+ celebrities** and influencers
- üéØ **2,000+ brand ambassadors** worldwide
- ‚è∞ **72-hour turnaround** for social media content

**The Old Nightmare:**
Sarah Mitchell, Global Events Director, describes the pre-AI era: *"We had teams of 15 people manually tagging photos around the clock. A single celebrity appearance at our Times Square event would generate 10,000 photos, and finding the best shots took days. By the time we delivered content, the moment had passed."*

### **The Breaking Point: Super Bowl 2024**

Coca-Cola's Super Bowl activation generated **75,000 photos** in 6 hours:
- Multiple celebrity appearances
- Hundreds of VIP guests  
- Changing lighting conditions
- Different camera equipment
- Urgent social media demands

**Traditional approach would have taken 3 weeks. Social media needed content in 3 hours.**
