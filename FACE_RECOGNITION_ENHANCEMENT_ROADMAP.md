## üéØ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Layered Architecture:**
```
Current System (Base Layer)
    ‚Üì
Phase 1: Quality + Performance (No code changes)
    ‚Üì  
Phase 2: New Models (Additive layers)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3: Advanced AI (Parallel processing)
    ‚Üì
Phase 4: Research Features (Optional modules)
