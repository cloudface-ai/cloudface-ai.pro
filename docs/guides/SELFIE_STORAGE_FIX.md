# 🔧 Selfie Storage Bug Fix

## 🐛 **The Problem**

Guest selfies were being saved as **0-byte empty files**, causing auto-search to fail with errors like:
```
⚠️ Error searching in single photo: cannot identify image file
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue Location**: `cloudface_pro_guest_auth.py` line 182

**The Bug:**
```python
# WRONG: Passing bytes directly to save_file()
storage.save_file(selfie_path, selfie_bytes)
```

**Why it failed:**
- `storage.save_file()` expects a **file-like object** (`BinaryIO`)
- We were passing **raw bytes** instead
- The storage layer couldn't read from bytes, resulting in 0-byte files

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **1. Wrapped bytes in BytesIO**
```python
# CORRECT: Wrap bytes in BytesIO for file-like interface
from io import BytesIO
storage.save_file(selfie_path, BytesIO(selfie_bytes))
```

### **2. Added validation**
In `cloudface_pro_server.py`:
```python
# Validate selfie is not empty
if not selfie_bytes or len(selfie_bytes) == 0:
    return jsonify({
        'success': False,
        'error': 'Selfie file is empty. Please try again.'
    }), 400

print(f"📸 Received selfie: {len(selfie_bytes)} bytes")
```

### **3. Added better logging**
```python
print(f"✅ Saved selfie for guest {guest_id}: {len(selfie_bytes)} bytes")
```

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Clear old empty selfie** (Already done)
```bash
rm -f storage/cloudface_pro/guests/8987bdba-12a/guest_8987bdba-12a_selfie.jpg
```

### **Step 2: Re-capture selfie**
1. Logout from guest account
2. Visit event: `http://localhost:5002/e/39f3d3a0-5ba`
3. Login with: `born8seven@gmail.com`
4. You'll be redirected to capture selfie (since old one was deleted)
5. Capture or upload a selfie
6. Click "Confirm"

### **Step 3: Verify selfie was saved**
```bash
ls -lh storage/cloudface_pro/guests/8987bdba-12a/
```

**Expected output:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 user  admin  45K Oct 14 12:00 guest_8987bdba-12a_selfie.jpg
```
(File size should be > 0, typically 20-100KB)

### **Step 4: Test auto-search**
1. Go to event page
2. Click "🔍 Find My Photos" button
3. Search should work without errors

## 📊 **What's Fixed**

✅ Selfies now save correctly (not 0 bytes)  
✅ Auto-search works with stored selfie  
✅ Better error messages if selfie is empty  
✅ Better logging for debugging  
✅ No more "cannot identify image file" errors

## 🔄 **For Existing Guests**

If a guest already has a 0-byte selfie:

**Option 1: Force re-capture**
```python
# Delete their old selfie from storage
rm storage/cloudface_pro/guests/<guest_id>/guest_<guest_id>_selfie.jpg

# Update database to remove selfie_filename
# Next login will prompt for selfie capture
```

**Option 2: Add "Re-capture Selfie" button**
```python
@app.route('/guest/recapture-selfie/<event_id>')
def recapture_selfie(event_id):
    if 'guest_id' not in session:
        return redirect(f'/guest/login/{event_id}')
    return render_template('cloudface_pro/capture_selfie.html', event=event)
```
